## Status code

Status code, be a important part from server response. With their, we can check what server understand about our request. Status code can be found in header of request.

Basically, we can classify status codes in groups, where each group be:

- [2xx](https://github.com/darlanmendonca/rest-styleguide/blob/master/status_code_2xx.md) - success status, server understand and will make what you want
- 3xx - redirection, further action may be needed
- [4xx](https://github.com/darlanmendonca/rest-styleguide/blob/master/status_code_4xx.md) - client error (the client is you), anything wrong, not found or not allowed by example.
- 5xx - an error occur in server
